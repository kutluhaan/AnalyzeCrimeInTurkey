🇹🇷 Analyze Crime in Turkey
📝 What's This All About?
Hey there! This project is a super cool web app made with Python and Flask. It's all about checking out crime data in Turkey! We're using official stats from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) to see how crime relates to things like how much education people have or how old they are. It's an interactive tool to help you visualize the data and get some interesting insights.

🚀 What Can It Do?
Cool Charts! We've got interactive charts and graphs that show you all the crime stats in a visual way.

Education Connection: Ever wonder if there's a link between education and crime? We've got data visualizations for that!

Crime Through the Years: You can see how crime trends have changed over time and spot any patterns.

Age Matters: Find out how crime rates vary across different age groups.

Easy to Use: It's a simple, web-based app so you can just open it up and start exploring the data right away.

⚙️ What's Under the Hood?
Python: Our go-to language for all the backend stuff and data magic.

Flask: A simple and awesome framework that helps us build the web app.

Pandas: The workhorse for handling all the data from those Excel files.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: These libraries make our charts look good and easy to understand.

HTML, CSS & JavaScript: The classic trio for making the app look and feel great!
